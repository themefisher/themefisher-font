Live demo: https://themefisher.github.io/themefisher-font/

Open *index.html* (or the live demo above) to see a list of all the glyphs in our font along with their codes/ligatures.

To use the generated font in a desktop program, you can install the TTF font. In order to copy the character associated with each icon, refer to the text box at the bottom right corner of each glyph in [the demo](https://themefisher.github.io/themefisher-font/). The character inside this text box may be invisible, but it can still be copied. See [this guide](https://icomoon.io/#docs/local-fonts) for more info. 

You won't need any of the files located under the *demo-files* directory when including the generated font in your own projects.

You can import `selection.json` [into the IcoMoon](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select) app using the *Import Icons* button (or via Main Menu â†’ Manage Projects) to retrieve your icon selection.
